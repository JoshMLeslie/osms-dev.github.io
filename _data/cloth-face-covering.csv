02-04-HK,HK Mask,"HK Mask is a reusable cloth mask with a disposable middle layer filter. It was invented by Dr. K. Kwong during the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020.

The design of HK Mask is referred by that of 3-layer surgical mask in the market. The HK Mask is composited with a disposable middle layer filter which is sandwiched by a cloth mask as the outer and inner layers. There are a number of material chosen for the middle layer filter ranging from Kitchen Towel Paper to Nanofilter.

The filtration efficiency of a piece of kitchen towel paper is close to that of N70. The mask can be safely used after replacing a new middle layer filter to a cleaning and sterilizing the inner and outer layer cloth",Cloth Face & PPE Coverings,cloth-face-covering,Supply,02,04,,,02-04-HK-,HK,,Yes,https://tinyurl.com/vewfjuh,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZusqX4Cfa3w&feature=emb_logo,https://tinyurl.com/y7487zc5,HKMask_example11.jpg (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/006c4910a28cd9ac0c342c10a00c9161/5858d412/HKMask_example11.jpg),,,HK mask/ Sew On Studio,Dr. K Kwong,Reusable,"""Community: low risk, preventative measure, used for < 6hrs"",Essential/Service workers: high risk for social exposure/community transmission,Healthcare: high risk of exposure to COVID patients","'- Using different colors on the front (outside facing; lighter color is better) and back (inside facing) part of the mask is ideal so that the sides can easily be recognized
- If using to protect existing PPE, using a light color for the outside of the mask is best so that the wearer can easily see soiling
- This design does not incorporate pleats, which may allow for more rapid production. The addition of a filter is optional, as well as wire nose bridge support. This design may be useful as a protective cover for the dome-shaped N95 mask. OSMS recommends using non-latex elastic or more preferably fabric ties if donating to healthcare workers. The DXF files can be used to make a manual fabric cutting template or one for laser cutting fabric.
