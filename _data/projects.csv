02-11-HK,HK Mask,"HK Mask is a reusable cloth mask with a disposable middle layer filter. It was invented by Dr. K. Kwong during the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020.

The design of HK Mask is referred by that of 3-layer surgical mask in the market. The HK Mask is composited with a disposable middle layer filter which is sandwiched by a cloth mask as the outer and inner layers. There are a number of material chosen for the middle layer filter ranging from Kitchen Towel Paper to Nanofilter.

The filtration efficiency of a piece of kitchen towel paper is close to that of N70.

Useful insight from pattern maker- Rolls of fabric are typically 60 in wide so the pattern fits sideways along the length of the roll. If you alternate the orientation of the full pattern by 180 degrees each time, you can minimize the waste. If you fold the fabric (or plastic) in half before cutting, the half pattern is easiest. I have only worn this gown when made out of thin plastic, so it's possible the head opening will be too small if you are using melt blown material or a durable water repellant fabric that has no stretch to it. The dashed lines above the head opening represent perforations that make a disposable version tear-away. I was able to seal the sleeve seams of this gown (a finely textured plastic like a cheap party tablecloth) by using a very low setting on my hair straightening iron.
