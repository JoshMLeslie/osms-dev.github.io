<ul>
  <li>900,000 US Hospital beds (<a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_REAC#">OECD</a>)
    <ul>
      <li>2/3rds of these are occupied at any given time (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/185904/hospital-occupancy-rate-in-the-us-since-2001/">source</a>)
        <ul>
          <li>Note: these are averages; many hospitals in city centers and suburban areas regularly operate with higher occupancies.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ICU bed estimates vary, in part because there are many types of ICU beds.
    <ul>
      <li>According to the <a href="https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals">AHA</a>, there are 97,776 total ICU beds in community hospitals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>According to CMS cost reports, there are about 62,000 (<a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/covid-19-could-fill-hospital-beds-how-many-are-there">Modern Healthcare - Analysis of CMS Cost Reports</a>; ). However, some hospitals do not report data to CMS.
    <ul>
      <li>Large regional referral centers have many more beds than the “average” urban hospital, which has about 10 ICU beds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
