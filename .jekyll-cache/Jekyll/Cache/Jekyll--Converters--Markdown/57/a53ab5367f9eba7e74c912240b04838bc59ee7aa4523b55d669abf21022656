<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem:</h1>

<p>COVID-19 causes fluid build up in the lungs, which then requires use of ventilators for the patient to have sufficient oxygen. An insufficient supply of these will lead to increased mortality.</p>

<p>Note: Based on doctor interviews the pre-intubation procedure is oxygen therapy via nasal cannula while putting a mask over the person‚Äôs mouth so they don‚Äôt aerosolize virus when they exhale or cough.</p>

<p>Non-invasive ventilation machines like CPAP, BiPAP, and hi-flo oxygen are discouraged on the west coast because they aerosolize the room with virus during exhalation.</p>

<p>Intubation (invasive ventilation) happens when patients go critical after long enough (intubation may happen immediately or after deterioration; rapid shallow breaths, high CO2 levels, low O2 levels and heavy use of chest muscles are indicators for potential intubation). The vast majority of patients require sedation for successful initial intubation (reviewed by Midwest Medical Practitioner, Cards).</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúThe report cited‚Ä¶a 2009 survey‚Ä¶indicating that hospitals could use both existing machines and pull older devices from storage, as well as the 8,900 sitting in emergency stockpiles. Combined,‚Ä¶ roughly 200,000 devices, but that the number of available medical staff able to operate them at any one time would lower that number significantly. With some worse-case estimates showing <strong>more than 900,000 people</strong> could need ventilators, according to the American Hospital Association‚Äù (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/demand-ventilators-spikes-coronavirus-looms/story?id=69597233">ABC News</a>, 3/14/20).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="staffing">Staffing:</h1>

<p>‚ÄúA typical ICU ventilator requires three primary operators: a critical care doctor, respiratory therapist, and a nurse.‚Äù (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/demand-ventilators-spikes-coronavirus-looms/story?id=69597233">ABC News</a>, 3/14/20).</p>

<p>‚ÄúA report yesterday by the critical-care society postulated an emergency staffing that has one ICU doctor overseeing 96 patients on ventilators. That doctor would command a staff of four non-ICU MDs brought in from other assignments, each of them looking after eight respiratory therapists, four ICU nurses and 12 non-ICU nurses (again, repurposed from other wards, like elective surgery)‚Ä¶there would be a role for quick courses in how to set up a particular model of ventilator and help the MD get the desired output. In a test run of emergency preparedness several years ago, Branson says, instructions in machine operation were given to medically trained people who had never seen the machine before: nurses, physicians, physical therapists and veterinarians. After a two-day, 16-hour course, the veterinarians scored the best.‚Äù (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2020/03/14/ventilator-maker-we-can-ramp-up-production-five-fold/#1db699545e9a">Forbes</a> 3/14/20).</p>
