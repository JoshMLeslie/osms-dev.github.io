<hr />

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem:</h1>

<p>Healthcare workers are exposed to infectious body fluids when working in close proximity to patients. Coughing, sneezing, and retching can expel droplets, which can transmit disease if the healthcare worker’s clothing comes into contact with these fluids. A protective gown covers the healthcare worker’s clothing so as to reduce the risk of direct contact with contaminated fluids.</p>

<h1 id="current-global-resources">Current Global Resources:</h1>

<p>Similar to other PPE, supply chain shortages of gowns have persisted for several weeks. Nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals are being asked to disinfect, reuse, and use alternative materials for gowns, including plastic ponchos, poly bags, bed bug sheet materials, and garbage bags.</p>

<h1 id="worst-case-expectation">Worst Case Expectation:</h1>

<h1 id="engineering-requirements">Engineering Requirements:</h1>

<p>Fabric</p>

<p>Gowns for patients:</p>

<p>Gown fabric needs to be the right mix of cotton/synthetic so it launders well but doesn’t create static. Static sparks are an issue for hospitals due to fire hazard from high O2 concentration environments.</p>

<p>Gowns for Healthcare Personnel: <strong>Class 2 Gowns</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Nonsterile, disposable patient isolation gowns, which are used for routine patient care in healthcare settings, are appropriate for use by patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Certain areas of surgical and isolation gowns are defined as <strong>“critical zones”</strong> where direct contact with blood, body fluids, and/or other potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur. (<a href="http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf">ANSI/AAMI PB70</a>)</li>
  <li>Medium to high risk of contamination and need for a large critical zone, isolation gowns that claim moderate to high barrier protection (<a href="http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf">ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4</a></li>
  <li>For healthcare activities with low, medium, or high risk of contamination, surgical gowns (<a href="http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf">ANSI/AAMI PB70 Levels 1-4)</a>These gowns are intended to be worn by healthcare personnel during sterile surgical procedures.</li>
  <li>If the risk of bodily fluid exposure is low or minimal, gowns that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection (<a href="http://my.aami.org/aamiresources/previewfiles/pb70_1206_preview.pdf">ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2</a> can be used. These gowns should not be worn during surgical or invasive procedures, or for medium to high risk contamination patient care activities.</li>
  <li>A surgical gown can function as a single-use disposable isolation gown, dependent on hospital supply levels. An isolation gown can’t function as a surgical gown because an isolation gown is not sterile.</li>
</ul>

            Notes: Due to the level of sewing and addition of wrist cuffs, this pattern is best used for washable isolation gowns. With cotton-weight fabric, it could be used for a patient hospital gown. With ripstop nylon or polyester washable fabric, it could make a reusable isolation gown for staff (see customer notes in the first link).

            Notes: Intended for single use disposable isolation gown. Useful insight from pattern maker- Rolls of fabric are typically 60 in wide so the pattern fits sideways along the length of the roll. If you alternate the orientation of the full pattern by 180 degrees each time, you can minimize the waste. If you fold the fabric (or plastic) in half before cutting, the half pattern is easiest. I have only worn this gown when made out of thin plastic, so it's possible the head opening will be too small if you are using melt blown material or a durable water repellant fabric that has no stretch to it. The dashed lines above the head opening represent perforations that make a disposable version tear-away. I was able to seal the sleeve seams of this gown (a finely textured plastic like a cheap party tablecloth) by using a very low setting on my hair straightening iron.
